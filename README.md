Thank you to Pretzel for the great tutorial on creating a Python JSON REST API wrapper library, I would not have gotten very far without it!
Go to [Python JSON REST API wrapper library: a How-To in 15 simple steps](https://www.pretzellogix.net/2021/12/08/how-to-write-a-python3-sdk-library-module-for-a-json-rest-api/) to see Pretzel's tutorial and create your own wrapper library.
